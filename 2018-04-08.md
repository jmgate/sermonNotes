# The Reality of Heaven

## John 14:1&ndash;14

*  Heaven = the Father's house = Paradise

1. Paradise is a place.
2. Paradise is a perspective.
3. Paradise is a person.

*  Why would Jesus tell the disciples to not be troubled?
   *  Jesus leaving soon; one will betray them; Peter will deny Jesus.
*  Paradise = actual place in space and time. (?)
*  2 Cor. 12; Rev. 4; 1 Thess. 4
*  You're so heavenly minded you're of no earthly good.
   *  Nope, Paradise is a perspective that shapes our[&hellip; everything in
      life.]
*  Truth is determined by God and His Word.
*  Word = tool by which we're shaped.
*  Believe
*  Abundant life of Jesus = example.
*  Jesus taught, healed, provided for people.
*  Works not greater in kind but in sphere of influence.
*  The gospel has reached the vast majority o the world today.
*  The gospel isn't the way to heaven, it's the way to God.
*  1 Pet. 3:18
*  Truth = person, and is known in the context of a personal relationship with
   Him.
*  Requests must fit within the parameters o His character and plan.
